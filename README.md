# morseCodeTranslator
This project translates Morse Code to English and vice versa using tokenizing. Once it receives a certain input file, it will translate it into a particular output file for the user to open.



Depending on a file type that the user inputs, I used if statements to see if I should be translating from morse to English or vice versa.
